    <p class="AboutMe">
      Describing oneself is one of the most difficult tasks in the world.
      However, I am going to describe myself in three different sections; first
      of all I would like to draw your attention on my personality because I
      believe personality is the most important phenomenon that helps a person
      to build a relationship with others. Then I will focus on my professional
      and academic expertise. <br />Luckily, I am obsessed with staying
      organized and making everyone’s life easier. It brings such a genuine joy
      to my heart to take the burden off of my loved one’s shoulders, and I
      always do anything I can to enhance that. Work is no different. There are
      not many things that can grow a company the way that trust and
      dependability can, and I pride myself in being so dedicated to both.
      <br />I have very diversified professional and academic backgrounds. I
      worked as a newspaper deliverer, car builder, sales person, shop manager,
      medical promotion executive for pharmaceutical companies, and teacher in a
      high school. In addition, I was an activist for Greenpeace Finland.
      Moreover, my mom owns a social welfare organization that works for
      distressed women in Bangladesh; so I have some practical experiences on
      development projects that aimed to make distressed women’s life better.
      <br />Last but not least, I studied several faculties that include General
      Science, Accounting, English Literature, Political Science, Psychology,
      Sociology, Intercultural Communication, and Public Management. Currently I
      am studying Full Stack Web Development at Business College Helsinki. I
      have two master’s degrees; one in Sociology and other one in Public
      Management. The performances throughout my student life are outstanding.
      For example, my average grade in second master’s degree in Public
      Management is 4 out of 5. My second master’s degree makes me specialist
      for multinational companies where the work force and communications are
      multicultural and diverse. The aim of the degree is to make experts for
      intercultural communication in multinational companies.
